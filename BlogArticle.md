                                                              HEALTH SERVICES ON WEAR OS 3
With new features, APIs, and tools to support developers in creating stunning, top-notch wearable experiences, Google released their biggest update to the Wear platform last year. In collaboration with Samsung, Wear OS 3 debuts a brand-new feature dubbed Health Services. This service offers fitness and health data collected through sensors, context-sensitive algorithms, and continuous health monitoring. 

Smart watches and fitness trackers that keep tabs on your activity level and basic health metrics are gradually taking over as essential lifestyle accessories. But those watches contain a lot of technology to track your heart health and level of physical activity. A standard smart watch or fitness band has about 16 sensors within, including an accelerometer, an altimeter, a gyroscope, etc. Depending on the functionality, some may have more and others less. A smart watch is developed by combining these sensors with other hardware elements like a display, speakers, batteries, microphone, and others, as well as powerful high-end software. 

Apps without Health Services must connect to one or more sensors, properly configure each one, receive raw sensor data, and then apply their own algorithms to extract useful information. For example, an app might register for updates of Sensor. TYPE_PRESSURE to get the current air pressure, use it to determine the current altitude, and combine this information across time to display the elevation changes that occurred while a user was participating in an activity. Health Services automatically collect sensor data, setup all fitness- and health-related sensors for the use-case, and compute metrics like heart rate, distance, calories, elevation, floors, speed, and more. Apps can register for this data directly from Health Services.

The community of fitness and health app developers benefits greatly from Health Services. But in this blog, I'd like to concentrate on three things: battery life, developer experience, and future-proofing. 

Starting with battery life In order to track activities like workouts, daily activity, and sleep, ideally across several days, sensors must be on constantly and operate at high frequency. On earlier smartwatches, each app on the main application processor was in charge of these sensors and related algorithms, and it would wake up whenever it required to process data (such as heart rate). The battery life was greatly affected by this method. With the help of Health Services, apps can take advantage of the new smartwatch architecture, which allows for much more data processing and collection to be offloaded to a low-power processor, allowing the application processor to be suspended for longer periods of time, such as when logging an exercise. As a result, Health Services may deliver high-frequency data while using a lot less power than some other APIs.

After that, I'd like to talk a about the development experience. Health Services gives developers a more cutting-edge environment in which to create health and fitness apps.  With Health Services, you only need to write your program once, and it will automatically adjust to any hardware variations. With the beta release, Google making health services more column friendly and introducing three new clients that correspond to the main use cases for health and fitness experiences.

All state management and sensor control for workouts is handled by ExerciseClient. It offers data like speed, distance, and heart rate as well as aggregates like total, min, and max. Additionally, it can manage sophisticated features like autopause and keep track of objectives for metrics like step count or calories. Your app can control when an activity is in progress, set exercise goals, and receive updates on the exercise state or other desired metrics with the help of ExerciseClient.

The PassiveMonitoringClient offers a battery-saving way to gather the typical all-day data, such step count, and enables apps to be informed of significant events, including when a user achieves their daily goals.

And finally, MeasureClient offers a mechanism to quickly obtain high-fidelity measurements of parameters like heart rate. Your app registers callbacks to get data for as long as you need with the MeasureClient APIs. This is for circumstances where your app is being used and a quick data update is necessary.

Let's quickly examine ExerciseClient, one of these clients. The code snippet below shows how simple it is to begin an exercise. Keep in mind that the platform provides data types for location, speed, and heart rate. Aggregated measures like average speed and total distance can also be calculated by health services.



val config = ExerciseConfig.builder()
        .setGpsEnabled(true)
        .setExerciseType(ExerciseType.RUNNING)
        .setDataTypes(dataTypes)
        	setOf(
			DataType.Location, DataType.HEART_RATE_BPM,
			DataType.SPEED_STATS, DataType.DISTANCE_EXERCISE_TOTAL )
	 .build()
	 
	 

And in the second snippet, we create an UpdateListener to watch for updates after we've begun the exercise. Health Services is also responsible for managing data and exercise states like active or paused.



val listener = object : ExerciseUpdateListener {
    override fun onExerciseUpdate(update: ExerciseUpdate) {
        // Process the latest information about the exercise.
        val exerciseStatus = update.state // Current state
        val activeDuration = update.activeDuration // Duration    
        val latestMetrics = update.latestMetrics // Mertics     

        val latestAggregateMetrics = update.latestAggregateMetrics    
        // AggregateMetrics
        val latestGoals = update.latestAchievedGoals 
        // latestAchievedGoals
        val latestMilestones = update.latestMilestoneMarkerSummaries



Let us just now discuss future-proofing. The technology behind smartwatches is developing quickly, and these gadgets get additional sensors and smarter algorithms every year. Health Services is designed to expand when these modifications are made, enabling your app to benefit from advancements via an API that is uniform across Wear devices. Google will add new data types to the APIs as new sensors are made accessible on new watches, and you'll have simple access to those metrics.

In summary, health services can help developers by utilizing powerful algorithms that are already present on the platform, utilizing Health Services' sensor setups that are optimized for power efficiency to conserve battery life, future-proofing an app for Wear 3 devices, as The Health Services API is consistent across Wear 3 devices making it easier to keep your app up to date, Ensuring data consistency across all applications on the same device by using standardized platform computations, enabling activity-aware experiences, such as the capability to identify a running workout that was initiated by another app. Developers may significantly improve user experiences and ensure greater acceptance rates among users by incorporating the corresponding Next-Gen technologies into health apps by employing Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning, Blockchain, IoT, Big Data, AR, and VR. Health Services offers a variety of services that let developers concentrate on implementing these unique features and user interfaces while still counting on the platform to deliver reliable measurements in a power-efficient way.
